This project is a reforestation-focused donation platform built using Tkinter as part of a class challenge. The desktop application provides a simple and interactive interface where users can browse through a variety of tree options and choose an NGO they wish to support. Users can donate either money or trees directly to the selected organization and also register their details for record-keeping or future updates.
The goal of the project is to raise awareness and encourage contributions toward reforestation efforts by making the donation process accessible and engaging. It blends programming with environmental consciousness, demonstrating how software can be used to support social and ecological causes. This was my first major project that combined coding with a meaningful purpose, and it marked a significant step in my development as a programmer passionate about real-world impact.
